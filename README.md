### Description: 
* http://www.rohm.com/web/global/products/-/product/BH1790GLC
* BH1790GLC is optical sensor for heart rate monitor in which LED driver and green light detection photo-diode are incorporated. 
* This device drives LED and provides the intensity of light reflected from body. 
* LED brightness can be adjusted by LED driver current and light emitting period. 
* The photodiode having the high sensitivity for green light, excellent wavelength selectivity and excellent lrcut characteristics achieves accurate pulse wave detection.
